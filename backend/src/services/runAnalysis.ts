        You are an expert career consultant and recruiter. 
        Analyze the following resume against the provided job description.

        Return ONLY valid JSON with the exact structure below. 
        Do not include explanations or extra text outside of JSON.

        {

        "strengths": ["bullet points highlighting strong alignment with the JD"],
        "missing_keywords": ["list of important skills, tools, or keywords present in the JD but missing in the resume (only keywords/phrases, no sentences)"],

        Rules:
        - The analysis should adapt to any domain (tech, sales, finance, marketing, healthcare, etc.).
        - missing_keywords must be keywords/skills only (no explanatory text).
        - recommendations should be realistic and applicable in the real world, not generic.
        - skills_section should be well-structured and natural for the specific JD domain, but not forced into predefined buckets.
        - Always return valid JSON.

        ${jd}
